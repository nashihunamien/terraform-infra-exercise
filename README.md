# Terraform Infra Exercise
This is personal terraform GCP exercise repo.
Infra diagram can be found in topology folder.

This terraform *runs locally with GCS backend* due to my personal GCP account features limitation. Github action is not running due to service account limitation as well.

This terraform exercise contains:
 - [x] Iam binding
 - [x] Private network, gateway, firewall, loadbalancer and dns setup
 - [x] GKE cluster with private network
 - [ ] Database cluster
 - [ ] Ansible bastion
 - [ ] Vault cluster
 - [x] Makefile
